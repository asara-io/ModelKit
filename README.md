# ModelKit

[![CI](https://github.com/asara-io/ModelKit/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/asara-io/ModelKit/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

ModelKit (`modelkit`) is a native OCaml library for cohesive classical machine learning workflows. It is designed around immutable estimator specifications, leakage-safe pipelines, deterministic evaluation, and portable fitted artifacts.

Python users of `scikit-learn` will find this library familiar in serving the same needs.

## Feature Highlights

- Reproducible foundations with deterministic random streams and stable reference numerical operations across supported platforms, OCaml versions, and execution schedules.
- Typed extension contracts separate immutable estimator specifications from fitted models and return actionable errors.
- Immutable, validated float64 data primitives catch shape, feature-order, and sample-alignment problems before model code runs.
- Dense datasets admit aligned features, targets, weights, groups, and names under an explicit finiteness policy; stable schema fingerprints and copy/view reports make compatibility and allocation behavior observable.

## Motivation and Future Work

The library is built with a strong focus first on correctness, portability, and reproducibility; performance is a secondary goal to follow.

To this end, you will note that there is a significant amount of from-scratch implementation under ModelKit's hood. When implementation milestones are hit for being useful in real-world data science workflows, ModelKit will undergo benchmarking to gauge its performance against alternate implementations, such as `scikit-learn` itself.

Anticipating performance benefits from existing work such as using Owl for a numerical engine and Lacaml for acceleration, integration tasks will likely be brought above the line. In that phase, users who have come to be familiar with the consistent contracts of ModelKit's public APIs will enjoy performance benefits without contract changes.

## Status

ModelKit 0.2.1 is the current foundation release and adds OCaml 5.5 build support to the 0.2.0 capabilities. The `0.3.x` development branch now includes immutable dense dataset admission, explicit `Require_finite` and `Allow_nan` feature policies, aligned zero-copy row views, stable versioned schema fingerprints, and explicit copy/view reporting. `Allow_nan` treats NaN as a missing-value marker but still rejects positive and negative infinity.

Dataset row views preserve ordering and duplicates without packing feature or metadata buffers. Use `Dataset.materialize` when an algorithm requires contiguous selected rows; its access report identifies the resulting copies. Concrete transformers, estimators, fitted artifacts, and end-to-end machine learning workflows are not yet implemented.

The portable package lives under `lib/`. Optional ecosystem adapters and accelerated backends are reserved under `adapters/` and `backends/`; they will remain separate packages that depend on the portable core when implemented.

## Development

ModelKit requires OCaml 5.2 or newer. The platform locks currently use OCaml 5.3.0. The following set of commands will assume that you have installed and configured `git` and `opam`. The generated documentation will be available at `_build/default/_doc/_html/index.html`.

### Initial Setup

```commandline
opam update
opam switch create . 5.3.0 --deps-only --with-test --with-doc  # If running for the first time.
opam install ocamlformat.0.29.0

opam exec -- dune build @all @runtest @doc @fmt @opam @install --auto-promote
opam lint modelkit.opam
```

### Windows

```commandline
opam lock ./modelkit.opam --lock-suffix=locked.windows-x86_64
opam install . --deps-only --with-test --with-doc --locked --lock-suffix=locked.windows-x86_64
```

### macOS (arm64)

```sh
opam lock ./modelkit.opam --lock-suffix=locked.macos-arm64
opam install . --deps-only --with-test --with-doc --locked --lock-suffix=locked.macos-arm64
```

The ordinary Dune workspace uses the repository-local opam switch automatically. Reproducible locks are platform-specific because compiler and system dependency packages differ by host.

The full test suite combines named unit tests, deterministic generated properties, metamorphic invariants, executable documentation, a compile-time public API consumer, and a reusable numerical-backend conformance suite.

GitHub Actions is configured to run the build, complete test suite, package build, and documentation generation on Linux x86-64, macOS arm64, and Windows x86-64 with OCaml 5.2, 5.3, and 5.5. These jobs use committed reference data and do not install or execute Python.

### Reference Fixtures and Benchmarks

Committed scikit-learn reference fixtures are ordinary test data, so the normal ModelKit build and test suite never require or execute Python. Maintainers only need the pinned development environment when regenerating those fixtures or collecting benchmark evidence. Python 3.14.3 is required, as recorded in `dev/python/PYTHON_VERSION`; the local virtual environment is stored in the ignored `env/` directory.

On Windows:

```commandline
env\Scripts\activate
python -m pip install --requirement dev\python\requirements.lock
python dev\fixtures\generate.py
python dev\benchmarks\run.py
```

On macOS/Linux:

```sh
source env/bin/activate
python -m pip install --requirement dev/python/requirements.lock
python dev/fixtures/generate.py
python dev/benchmarks/run.py
```

The committed smoke benchmark validates the measurement workflow only and is explicitly ineligible to support performance claims in the current build. Algorithm-specific comparative reports will use the release benchmark contract once equivalent ModelKit estimators exist.
